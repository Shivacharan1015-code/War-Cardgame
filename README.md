# War-Cardgame
Hello there, this is my second big project in python, its WAR CARD-GAME, and you can see that to mimic to cards i have used numbers even for jack(11), queen(12), king(13), just to make my life easier :), anyway it was fun creating this project and also keep in mind that there are many parts of the code that can be reduced or written in less lines, im well aware of that, but at the time of uploading this im gonna keep my original file and im not gonna update here on GitHub it because i think its fun to always look back and see the code that how I used to write written and feel embarrassed about myself ;) Thank you for viewing my code, if there are any :).
